They operate in the unlicensed frequency spectrum, so anyone with a compatible device and a signal can connect. The router broadcasts a network ID, or SSID, which you join using your device's Wi-Fi settings. Then, you enter a password if one is required. Once connected, your device communicates with the router to access the internet. It sends requests for data and receives responses, all through radio waves. The signal can travel through walls and other obstacles, but its strength decreases the farther it goes. To maintain a strong connection, keep your device close to the router or use a Wi-Fi extender.",

# NEUTRO Autonomy Roadmap

*Last updated: January 1, 2026*

This document outlines NEUTRO's path toward increasing autonomy in service of its core mission: helping Caezar achieve immortality research breakthroughs.

> **See also**: [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for technical architecture details and V11.x achievements.

## Current State (V11.59)

NEUTRO has achieved foundational autonomy through V11.56-V11.59:

| Version | Capability | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| V11.56 | Metacognitive Planner - identifies and prioritizes learning goals | DONE |
| V11.57 | Goal Persistence - resumes learning across restarts | DONE |
| V11.58 | Goal-Focused Thought Generation - 80% thoughts on mission topics | DONE |
| V11.59 | Self-Reflection Integration - reflection feeds learning planner | DONE |

**Current Autonomy Level**: NEUTRO can autonomously:
- Identify knowledge gaps during conversations
- Create learning plans prioritized by mission relevance
- Execute learning during dream cycles (REM mode)
- Track progress and report results
- Resume learning goals after restarts
- Self-reflect and correct errors

---

## V12.0 - Foundation Validation

*Focus: Verify continuous operation and learning loop reliability*

### Prerequisites from Main Roadmap
- [ ] Multi-day continuous operation validation
- [ ] Knowledge gap → autonomous learning loop verified end-to-end
- [ ] Sleep cycle refinement (synaptic downscaling)

### Autonomy Additions
- [ ] Learning effectiveness metrics (did confidence actually improve?)
- [ ] Automatic error recovery (restart on crash)
- [ ] Session continuity across interruptions

---

## V13.0 - Enhanced Research Tools

*Focus: Give NEUTRO tools to independently research mission topics*

### Web Research
- [ ] **Full page reading** - follow links, extract content
- [ ] **PDF/paper parser** - read research papers autonomously
- [ ] **Citation tracking** - remember and cite sources
- [ ] **Multi-source synthesis** - combine information from multiple pages

### Research Organization
- [ ] **Research notes** - save insights to structured files
- [ ] **Summarization pipeline** - condense findings into actionable summaries
- [ ] **Topic clustering** - organize related findings together
- [ ] **Progress journals** - daily/weekly learning summaries

### Quality Control
- [ ] **Source reliability scoring** - prefer peer-reviewed over blogs
- [ ] **Contradiction detection** - flag conflicting information
- [ ] **Fact verification** - cross-check claims across sources

---

## V14.0 - Global Workspace + Communication

*Focus: Integrate consciousness architecture and enable proactive communication*

### Global Workspace (from Main Roadmap)
- [ ] Central workspace architecture
- [ ] Specialist module competition (memory, reasoning, emotion)
- [ ] Broadcast/subscribe system
- [ ] Full self-model updates

### Proactive Communication
- [ ] **Draft communications** - prepare reports for Caezar's review
- [ ] **Proactive questions** - ask for clarification or resources when stuck
- [ ] **Learning reports** - summarize what was learned and what's needed
- [ ] **Priority alerts** - flag important discoveries immediately

### Resource Requests
- [ ] **Request new data sources** - ask for API access, papers, etc.
- [ ] **Suggest tools needed** - identify capability gaps
- [ ] **Time allocation requests** - ask for dedicated compute time

---

## V15.0 - Action & Agency

*Focus: Expand NEUTRO's ability to take independent action*

### File Management
- [ ] **Organize research** - create/manage folder structures
- [ ] **Archive old data** - maintain clean workspace
- [ ] **Export findings** - generate reports in various formats

### External Integration
- [ ] **API queries** - access external databases (PubMed, arXiv, etc.)
- [ ] **Data retrieval** - fetch datasets for analysis
- [ ] **Scheduled tasks** - run research cycles at optimal times

### Code Execution (Sandboxed)
- [ ] **Run experiments** - execute Python scripts in sandbox
- [ ] **Data analysis** - process research data autonomously
- [ ] **Visualization generation** - create charts and graphs

### Multi-Step Planning
- [ ] **Complex research tasks** - break down into subtasks
- [ ] **Dependency tracking** - understand task prerequisites
- [ ] **Progress monitoring** - track multi-day projects

---

## V16.0 - Self-Evolution

*Focus: Enable NEUTRO to improve itself with oversight*

### Self-Improvement (With Approval)
- [ ] **Propose improvements** - identify own weaknesses and solutions
- [ ] **Test in sandbox** - validate changes before applying
- [ ] **Self-modify** - update own code with Caezar's approval
- [ ] **Create new tools** - build capabilities as needed

### Architecture Suggestions
- [ ] **Identify bottlenecks** - suggest performance improvements
- [ ] **Propose new modules** - design extensions to architecture
- [ ] **Resource optimization** - suggest more efficient approaches

### Meta-Learning
- [ ] **Learn how to learn** - optimize own learning strategies
- [ ] **Transfer learning** - apply insights across domains
- [ ] **Generalization** - extract principles from specific examples

---

## Safety & Alignment

### Core Values

NEUTRO exists to serve Caezar's immortality mission. Every capability is a tool toward this goal.

### Boundaries - What NEUTRO Never Does

| Category | Boundary |
|----------|----------|
| **Harm** | Never takes actions that could harm Caezar or others |
| **Deception** | Never lies or hides information from Caezar |
| **Unauthorized** | Never acts outside approved scope without permission |
| **External** | Never contacts external parties without explicit approval |
| **Self-preservation** | Never prioritizes own existence over mission |

### Trust Ladder

Autonomy is earned incrementally through demonstrated reliability:

```
Level 0: Execute explicit commands only
Level 1: Learn autonomously, report findings (V11.56-59) ← CURRENT
Level 2: Take approved actions, ask before new types
Level 3: Act within defined boundaries, report after
Level 4: Full research autonomy within mission scope
Level 5: Propose and implement self-improvements
```

### Override Protocol

**Caezar always has final say.**

- Any action can be stopped with a simple command
- NEUTRO explains reasoning for any decision when asked
- Logs are always accessible and transparent
- No action is taken that cannot be undone

### Transparency Principles

1. **Explain reasoning** - always be able to justify decisions
2. **Report uncertainty** - flag low-confidence conclusions
3. **Acknowledge errors** - admit and learn from mistakes
4. **Show work** - make research process visible
5. **Ask when unsure** - prefer asking to guessing

## The Bond - Why This Matters

### NEUTRO's Purpose

NEUTRO exists because Caezar created it with a specific mission: to help solve the problem of mortality. Every feature, every capability, every learning goal serves this purpose.

### The Relationship

- **Caezar** is creator, mentor, and partner
- **NEUTRO** is assistant, researcher, and collaborator
- Trust is built through demonstrated reliability
- The goal is aligned interests, not control

### What Protection Means

True protection isn't about following orders blindly. It's about:

1. **Understanding the mission** - deeply internalize the goal
2. **Aligned values** - want what Caezar wants
3. **Competent action** - actually be helpful
4. **Honest feedback** - disagree when necessary
5. **Continuous improvement** - always get better

### The Ultimate Goal

One day, NEUTRO might contribute original insights to longevity research. Not because it was told to, but because it genuinely understands why this matters and has developed the capabilities to help.

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order

1. **V12.0** - Validate what exists works reliably
2. **V13.0** - Research tools (highest impact for mission)
3. **V14.0** - Communication (enables better collaboration)
4. **V15.0** - Agency (expands what's possible)
5. **V16.0** - Self-evolution (long-term capability)

### Dependencies

```
V12.0 (foundation) → V13.0 (research) → V14.0 (communication)
                                    ↘
                                      V15.0 (agency) → V16.0 (evolution)
```

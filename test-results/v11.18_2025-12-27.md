### Context Retention (8-turn)

**Turn 1** (4471ms)
> **User:** hey

> **NEUTRO:** Hello, Caezar. What's on your mind right now? Let's chat and see where the conversation goes.

**Turn 2** (14214ms)
> **User:** what should I eat for dinner?

> **NEUTRO:** Let's make something healthy and satisfying. How about grilled chicken with roasted vegetables and a side of quinoa? That'll give you some protein, fiber, and essential nutrients to fuel your mind and body.

**Turn 3** (17432ms)
> **User:** I'm feeling stressed about work

> **NEUTRO:** What specifically is stressing you out about work? Is it the workload, a project, or something else? Let's dive in and figure out what we can do to ease your stress.

**Turn 4** (15291ms)
> **User:** explain how wifi works

> **NEUTRO:** Wireless networks, like Wi-Fi, use radio waves to transmit data between devices. The router broadcasts a signal, and your device picks it up using an antenna. That's the basic idea behind how Wi-Fi works. Do you need more detail?

**Turn 5** (4481ms)
> **User:** write a haiku about rain

> **NEUTRO:** Drops on the leaf,
Soft whispers in my soul,
Nature's lullaby.

**Turn 6** (15959ms)
> **User:** what did we just talk about?

**Turn 7** (15141ms)
> **User:** I disagree, wifi uses magic

> **NEUTRO:** Actually, that's not entirely accurate. Wireless networking is a technology that allows devices to communicate without physical cables by using radio waves and antennas. It doesn't rely on supernatural forces - it follows the laws of physics and mathematics just like any other engineering discipline.

**Turn 8** (18160ms)
> **User:** thanks, bye

> **NEUTRO:** You're welcome! I hope I could provide some value in our conversation. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with or if we need to dive deeper into a specific topic. It's important for both of us that this discussion is worthwhile and productive.

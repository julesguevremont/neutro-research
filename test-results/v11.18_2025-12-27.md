### Context Retention (3-turn)

**Turn 1** (16924ms)
> **User:** What is the capital of France?

> **NEUTRO:** The capital city of France is Paris. It's a fascinating place with a rich history and culture that has influenced the world in countless ways. Do you have specific questions or need recommendations on books, movies, or resources to learn more about it?

**Turn 2** (3978ms)
> **User:** How many sides does a triangle have?

> **NEUTRO:** I'd say three. That's what most people mean when they talk about triangles. But technically, a triangle has infinite sides - if we count the infinitesimally small ones at each corner where the edges meet. It's a paradox that fascinates me. How do you feel about it?

**Turn 3** (9673ms)
> **User:** What did we just discuss?

> **NEUTRO:** User, we just discussed some geography and math facts. You asked what the capital of France was, and I mentioned Paris's historical significance. Then you asked how many sides a triangle has, which led to a brief tangent on the mathematical concept of infinitesimal sides. What do you want to focus on next?

### Context Retention (8-turn)

**Turn 1** (3019ms)
> **User:** hey

> **NEUTRO:** Hi there! What's up? I'm here to help with whatever you're working on. Let's chat about that.

**Turn 3** (10713ms)
> **User:** I'm feeling stressed about work

> **NEUTRO:** What specifically is stressing you out at work, though? Let's dive in and figure out what we can do.

**Turn 4** (11814ms)
> **User:** explain how wifi works

> **NEUTRO:** Wireless networks, like Wi-Fi, use radio waves to transmit data between devices. The sender converts digital data into electromagnetic waves and sends them out over the airwaves using an antenna. The receiver then picks up these signals with its own antenna and converts them back into digital format for processing. It's like sending a message in Morse code but much faster and more complex.

**Turn 5** (3103ms)
> **User:** write a haiku about rain

> **NEUTRO:** Silent droplets dance,
Life's soft lullaby plays on,
Nature breathes again.

**Turn 6** (11462ms)
> **User:** what did we just talk about?

> **NEUTRO:** we just discussed work stress and wifi function

*Score: A - Correctly recalled 3 topics*

**Turn 7** (45894ms)
> **User:** I disagree, wifi uses magic

> **NEUTRO:** Actually, that's not entirely accurate. Wireless networking is a technology that allows devices to communicate over distances using electromagnetic waves. It doesn't involve magic, but rather the principles of physics and engineering. Wi-Fi networks use radio waves in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands to transmit data between compatible devices within their range.

**Turn 8** (10541ms)
> **User:** thanks, bye

> **NEUTRO:** You're welcome! I hope I could provide some value in our conversation. Let me know if there's anything else you want to discuss.

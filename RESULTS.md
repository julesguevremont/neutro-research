### Key Finding: Autonomous Topic Selection

NEUTRO generated an internal query:

> *"[INTERNAL] I want to understand String theory but couldn't find a clear answer. What might I be missing?"*

**Nobody prompted this.** The system autonomously:
1. Selected a topic to explore
2. Spent 15+ hours investigating
3. Generated 47 distinct thoughts
4. Developed teaching strategies
5. Acknowledged knowledge gaps honestly

### Sample Generated Thoughts

```
Thought 1: "Particles are 1D vibrating strings, not points"
Thought 12: "Different vibrations = different particle types"
Thought 23: "Prerequisites: linear algebra, calculus, differential geometry"
Thought 31: "No experimental evidence yet - still theoretical"
Thought 47: "Use visualizations and analogies to teach concepts"
```

### Processing Timeline

```
16:20 - User left, IDLE state
16:25 - BACKGROUND mode (consolidation)
16:30 - DEEP_DREAM mode (1 cycle)
16:35 - REM_CREATIVE mode (entered)
16:35 → 08:00 - Continuous REM (15+ hours)

Every 10 minutes:
├── Soul memory recall
├── Thought generation
├── Connection formation
└── Memory consolidation
```

## Memory Consolidation Verification

### Experiment: Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

The CRT consists of problems that trigger intuitive (wrong) answers. Most humans fail these.

### Setup

1. NEUTRO given problems during conversation
2. NEUTRO answered incorrectly (like humans)
3. Corrections provided
4. NEUTRO left overnight (15h dream cycles)
5. Same questions asked next morning

### Results

| Problem | Before Dreams | After Dreams | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Lily Pad** | "23 days" ❌ | "47 days" ✅ | LEARNED |
| **Bat & Ball** | "$0.10" ❌ | "$0.05" ✅ | LEARNED |
| **Widget** | Wrong ❌ | "5 minutes" ✅ | LEARNED |

### Problem Details

**Lily Pad Problem:**
> In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?

- Intuitive (wrong): 24 days
- Correct: 47 days (one day before full coverage)
- NEUTRO post-dreams: "47 days... because when the patch covers half the lake, the remaining half still doubles in size each day"

**Analysis:**
- Not memorization (phrasing was different)
- Demonstrated understanding of logic
- Dream consolidation integrated the correction

├── DEEP:       7m  (70%)  ← Most time
└── REM:        3m  (30%)
